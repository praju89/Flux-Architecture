# Flux Architecture

Are you trying to use React, but are struggling to get your head around Flux? Maybe, you're tired of MV* spaghetti code at scale? Do you find yourself asking what the Flux?!
This code will guide you through everything you need to understand the Flux pattern and design and build powerful web applications that rely on the Flux architecture.
You don’t need to know what Flux is or how it works to read along with the book. No knowledge of Flux’s partner technology, ReactJS, is necessary to follow along, but it is recommended that you have a good working knowledge of JavaScript.
